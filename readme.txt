Profit Reports for WooCommerce is a powerful plugin which enables profit reporting on every order, based on cost of goods & overhead costs.

==Description==

Codup WooCommerce Profit Report settings integrate with WooCommerce to provide you with the insights of your profits and helps in tracking your revenue. 
Enable the profit reporting from WP Admin->WooCommerce->Profit Report Settings and complete the setup to analyze your revenue. 

**Profit Settings**

The plugin allows you to set up profit reporting on each order globally as well as for each individual order. 

* Cost Price: Cost Price is the original price of the product. It is required to calculate profit. You can set cost of single product from 'Product > Edit Product' Page. Default cost is used when product does not have a valid cost price. Cost price can be set in terms of percentage or fixed value. 

* Overhead Settings: Overhead Cost is all the cost other than original price of the product. It is deducted from the revenue to calculate product, just like cost. Overhead is set globally for all products. Just like cost price, overhead cost can also be set in terms of percentage or fixed value. 

Once the profit report is enabled, you can see the detailed report at WP Admin->Profit Reports. An overview of the report is present at WP Admin dashboard as well.
